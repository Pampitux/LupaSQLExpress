# LupaSQLExpress
This application was created as part of a project related to my studies.
It allows its users to change their passwords in order to access the computer system of their company.
The first connection to the application requires a license key as well as the information of the agent (name, first name, number).
The information entered will be compared with those contained in the database to access the rest.
The database was created under SQL server and it contains two main tables, 
one contains the people listed containing their id, name, first name, email addresses, password, etc..
The ConnectSQLSRV class allows to connect to the database.
The Spash screen allows according to the data stored in the application, 
either to open the activity identity to enter its information, or the activity Main which allows to change its password.
As a bonus, a button allows you to copy the code entered and open the page of the site targeted in the code.
